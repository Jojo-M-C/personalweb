Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Johanna Christoph, Iâ€™m a Computer Science Student from Austria working on achieving my <a href="/impossible-list">Impossible List</a>. 

<img class="thumbnailshadow" src="img/mountain.jpg"/>

## What is that? 

The idea behind the Impossible List, originally created by Joel Runyon, is to create a list of actions that are challenging but achievable. It is not meant to be a one-time checklist. Instead, it is a living document that evolves over time. As I accomplish items on my list, Iâ€™m going to continue to add new challenges and goals to continue pushing myself further. This is not about being the greatest right away, itâ€™s about taking small steps every day to eventually reach a designated goal. 

## Interviews
One of the perks of being involved in the startup ecosystem is the opportunity to encounter captivating and inspiring individuals on a regular basis. Hearing about all of their successes, frustrations, failures and learnings is something I consider tremendously valuable and would therefore like to share (only with their permission of course) for others to enjoy. 

## Articles 

In addition to that, I am also venturing into the world of blogging, where I dive into a myriad of captivating topics, developments, tools, and more that I encounter in my daily life and find intriguing. The purpose is to create a space where I can chronicle and share my explorations, insights, observations, and progress without the burden of striving for perfection. I might get things wrong at times, great, tell me and letâ€™s have this be a <a href="/contact">conversation starter</a>.
